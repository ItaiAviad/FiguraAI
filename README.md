FiguraAI is an AI project developed by Itai Aviad as a part of the Computer Science Bagrut.
<br>It was created to help children and people with learning disabilities learn about different shapes by recognizing hand drawn shapes.

## Requirements

* `pip` installed
* `python3` installed
* `git` installed - for cloning the github repository (**optional**)

## Running

1. Downloading the github repository in one of two ways:<br>
    * Cloning the github repository by running the following command in the cmd: `git clone https://github.com/ItaiAviad/FiguraAI.git`.
    * Downloading a `ZIP` file which contains all the files in the repository by clicking "_Download ZIP_" in the repository page:<br> ![Download ZIP](https://files.itik.tk/r/DownloadZIP.png)

    **Note**: The github repository includes:
      * All of the dataset files used in the project (~60MB). Those files are important if you want to run the code blocks that use the dataset.
      * The `cords.csv` file which is used to train the model.
      * Images connected to the project.
      * `requirements.txt` to list all the necessary python libraries. 

2. Installing all the necessary python libraries from `requirements.txt` by running the following command in the cmd: <br>`pip install -r requirements.txt`. Alternative command (if the first one doesn't work): `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Opening the `FiguraAI.ipynb` file which includes the entire project.
